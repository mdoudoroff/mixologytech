          <h2>“Will there be an Android version?”</h2>

          <p><strong>No.</strong> That is the short answer.</p>

          <p>The long answer is long, and doubtless incomplete, but here goes:</p>

          <p>App development is expensive. To produce the underlying framework for these products—mainly in terms of programming—and the products themselves required <strong>a cash outlay on the order of a very nice imported automobile</strong>. Factoring in other development costs, we’re in supercar territory. That’s just to get these products out for iOS.</p>

          <p><strong>Cocktail apps are niche products.</strong> They will never sell in the millions, and even hundreds of thousands is stretch. That means that recouping the initial investment at $10 a sale takes a long while.</p>

          <p>Working against us is the extreme downward price pressure of mobile apps. <strong>If these apps were selling at the same rate, but everybody was paying $40 each instead of $10, not only would the entire business proposition be more reasonable, but the apps would have more features and could be developed more aggressively.</strong> But if I charged $40 each for these apps, sales would probably crater because $40 is perceived as too much to pay for apps, even by highly motivated customers. That’s the world we live in.</p>

          <p><strong>To create and maintain Android versions of these apps would be like investing in another very nice imported automobile long before the first one is paid off.</strong> Factor in that app revenues from Android are typically around 25% those of iOS (Android customers buy far fewer apps than iOS customers) and the prospects look remote. So, <em>never say never</em>, but for now, it’s actually far more realistic for sufficiently-motivated Android users to pick up an iPad to run these apps than it is for me to provide them with Android versions. I wish it wasn’t so.</p>
