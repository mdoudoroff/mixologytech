            Martin’s Index of Cocktails and Mixed Drinks is a practical reference to the drink recipes of the first “golden age” of the American Bar (1850s until Prohibition).
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Over 700 drink recipes including classics and curiosities</li>
            <li>Pretty much all the formulas of interest from Jerry Thomas, Leo Engel, George Winter, O. H. Byron, Theodore Proulx, Harry Johnson, “Cocktail Bill” Boothby,William Schmidt, George J. Kappeler, Louis Fouquet, Tim Daly, Stuart Thomas, Charles S. Mahoney, John Applegreen, Jack A. Grohusko, Jacques Straub, Hugo R. Ensslin, Tom Bullock, Robert Vermeire and others!</li>
            <li>More drinks from Prohibition and post-Prohibition years will be added over coming months through free, over-the-wire updates</li>
            <li>The spiritual sequel to the old “Cocktails+” app from years back</li>
            <li>Check off the ingredients you’ve got and this app will show you which drinks you can make!</li>
            <li>Filter the recipes on multiple criteria with just a few taps</li>
            <li>Track favorite and flagged recipes</li>
            <li>Ingredient definitions included</li><li>Works the same as our five-star app, <a href="../totaltiki/index.html">Beachbum Berry’s Total Tiki</a></li>
            <li>Universal app, works nearly identically on both platforms</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sorry, we haven’t yet got a demo video for you; for now, please see the screen shots and relate them to the demo video for <a href="../totaltiki/index.html">Beachbum Berry’s Total Tiki</a>, which has a similar interface.</p>

            <p>“Though I’m reviewing this as it is fairly new and only contains drinks from pre-Prohibition sources, this app is well worth its price. That it will continue to expand with new recipes, sources, ingredients, and historical notes makes it a bargain. Detailed, accurate recipes with proper source attribution. Multiple ways to explore drinks not only related by specific indexed information (e.g., source or ingredients) but related through curatorial observation (e.g., the Merry Widow Cocktail from 1909 is basically the same as the Diplomate Cocktail from 1922) or the Marguerite’s role as a proto-Martini. Excellent home inventory management tied clearly to “drinks you can make” with your current ingredients, or the addition of 1 or 2 more. Lists of relevant brands for ingredients, quite useful in mapping a modern ingredient to its differently named ancestor (e.g., “pimento dram” available as St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram). Links from ingredients back to all the recipes which use them; so handy for those moment like “Well, I bought this creme de violette for the Aviation, now what else can we make with it?” That’s not a complete list of features by any stretch, but ones which have especially delighted me so far. I will also note that the creator of the app is very responsive to issue reports and feedback. Updates are one easy click when launching the app and load fast; I’ve seen two updates come in at least and the app hasn’t been out two weeks yet. In short, this is a magical font of drink knowledge which will keep flowing for your happiness!” –MetaGrrrl</p>

            <p>“Great app! Please make more like this.” —Harold Pinkler</p>

            <p>“Well worth the cost. I've been stubbornly holding on to my copy of Cocktails+, may be able to let it go now. Immediately upon download, there were updates, which is promising. UI is solid, works well on my aging iPhone 4S. If you blanch at the price tag, consider that to collect reference on all this number of recipes even as eBooks would cost an order of magnitude more.” —0x6772</p>

            <p>“This what the future is supposed to be like” —BallardBoy</p>
