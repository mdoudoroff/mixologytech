        <p style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:.5em;">What I’m doing here is starting at the beginning—the mid-19th Century—and clawing my way forward, casting the widest net I can, emcompassing as many historical sources as seem to matter. I’m gathering here both the essential, well-known drinks and the obscure curiosities, while trying to skip recipes that are redundant or don’t seem to add value.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:.5em;">The basic criterion for a recipe’s inclusion is whether it is <em>mixologically interesting and/or historically important</em>. The goal is to have a recipe collection that is eminently practical and <em>essentially complete</em> (as opposed to exhaustive). Literally thousands of recipes have been carefully excluded because, frankly, they were just noise.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:.5em;">I strive to provide the earliest recipes for a given drink, as well as show any subsequent recipes that significantly evolve said drink. However, it’s terribly easy to overstate the significance of dates. Just because a recipe first appears in a source doesn’t imply authorship. Sometimes authorship is clear, usually not. We’re also still discovering older recipes for drinks from time to time. Moreover, most drinks are built on earlier ideas that emerged from the anonymous mixological zeitgeist of the time (“standing on the shoulders of giants”), and by the time many of these drinks made print, they’d already been kicking around for a while in one form or another, often explored and iterated in parallel in different places by different people. Finally, the earliest versions of drinks were often not the best versions. So, while this app tries hard be true to, illustrate and enliven the historical record, please take any apparent implications with a grain of salt.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:.5em;">As part of the process, I’m <em>normalizing</em> the recipes into a consistent, terse, linear format, with predictable terminology. Proportions are faithful to original texts wherever possible. I’m also researching corrections—some recipes I had to adapt significantly due to carelessness in the original sources—and adding annotations and groupings. A handful of broken recipes are included for historical reasons. While normalization retains little trace of the original verbiage, it makes the material much more coherent and useful. Full citations are always provided, so you can look up the original text whenever you are sufficiently motivated.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:.5em;">All the recipes in this app are here for a reason, but not every drink is good, let alone bulletproof. Most can be elevated by an experienced hand and careful discretion. You have to think carefully about your choice of ingredients and technique, and tweak or adapt to suit your good taste. This is the deep end of pool.</p>
