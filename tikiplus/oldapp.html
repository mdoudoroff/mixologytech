    <p>In the Spring of 2009, Skorpiostech, Inc. released an iPhone app called <strong>Tiki+</strong> that featured exotic drink recipes from Jeff “Beachbum” Berry. The icon looked like this:</p>
    <div class="photo">
    <img src="gfx/icon-oldapp.png" width="115" height="115" alt="old Tiki+ icon"><br>
    Tiki+
    </div>
          <p>This Tiki+ app was a itself a spin-off of another app, Cocktails+, from the same company.</p>
    <p>For a variety of good reasons, Skorpiostech closed and its assets were distributed in a few different directions. Tiki+ ultimately became the property of Martin Doudoroff LLC. Alas, for a variety of completely unclear reasons, Apple has no facilities to transfer an app from one company to another within the App Store. Consequently, Tiki+ was delisted from the App Store and the customer base—including you, perhaps—was lost forever.</p>
    <p>Tiki+ was off the market and that was it. Meanwhile, the landscape changed: the iPad and iPhone 4 appeared and Jeff Berry released his definitive new book <em>Beachbum Berry Remixed</em> (go <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beach-Bum-Berry-Remixed-Jeff/dp/1593621396">buy it</a>, it’s awesome). We decided to give this iOS thing another try, and the result, many months later, was the launch of <a href="index.html"><strong>Beachbum Berry’s Tiki+</strong></a> in November 2010.</p>

    <p>Beachbum Berry’s Tiki+ is Version 2.0. Sort of.</p>
    <p>The new app differs from the old app in the following respects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regardless of significant overlap, Beachbum Berry’s Tiki+ is a distinct product from a different company. If you want this new app, you’ll have to purchase it. There is <em>nothing whatsoever</em> that Martin Doudoroff LLC can do about that other than keep the price low, which we have endeavored to do.</li>
      <li>The new app is a “Universal app” designed for both the iPad and the iPhone/iPod Touch. This adaptation required a surprisingly enormous effort, but we’re quite proud how it turned out.</li>
      <li>The new app includes twenty four additional recipes researched or invented by The Bum!</li>
      <li>The new app has more pictures, and they’re Retina display resolution.</li>
      <li>The new app has a greatly expanded help section.</li>
      <li>The new app lets you annotate any recipe with your own notes.</li>
      <li>The new app is simplified, streamlined, and omits several features that were present in the old app. The tabbed interface is now gone, along with several of the indexes. Favorites sync is gone. The problematic Twitter and Facebook features have been removed. While a few people may miss some of these features, we know they were all underutilized, and by stripping them out, the app feels more focused and Apple-like.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have the original Tiki+ app, you may continue to use it for as long as you keep it on your device(s), and there’s no reason you shouldn’t do so.</p>
  <p>We have worked hard to try to deliver the best product we can without the benefit of unlimited resources. We hope you’ll enjoy our efforts. If you have any questions or complaints, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
